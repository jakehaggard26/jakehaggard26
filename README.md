##### About Me
I've always enjoyed the creativity and problem solving skills that come along with programming. I also **love** being able to  take an idea or a solution and create it via programming. I'm always trying to learn more about a programming language I know or learn a new language. If Im not doing that then Im either binge watching TV shows and/or YouTube videos, gaming, golfing, playing with my dog Jody, or hanging out with friends:)
